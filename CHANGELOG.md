# dbt_zuora v0.2.0
[PR #8](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_zuora/pull/8) includes the following breaking changes:

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Redesigned `zuora__billing_history` and `int_zuora__billing_enriched` so `invoice_id` was the actual grain, accounting for the cases when invoices can be tied to multiple credit balance adjustments and payments. This required the following steps:
    - All metrics associated with `credit_balance_adjustment_id` were aggregated on the invoice level (number of credit balance adjustments,total credit balance amount in home currency, first and last dates of credit balance adjustments on the invoice). Fields associated with an individual `credit_balance_adjustment_id` were removed.
    - All metrics associated with `payment_id` were aggregated on the invoice level (number of payments, total payment amount in home currency, first and last dates of payments on the invoice). Fields associated with an individual `payment_id` were removed.
    - Aggregated count of `payment_method_id` to gather a count of payment methods on each invoice.
- Updated yml of `zuora__billing_history` with aggregated fields, and removed non-aggregated fields associated with credit balance adjustments, payments, and payment methods.
- Modified `int_zuora__account_enriched` to account for new aggregated metric fields being pulled from `zuora__billing_history`. 

## ðŸ”§ Under The Hood ðŸ”©
- Updated seed files in `integration_tests` to reproduce the initial `invoice_id` test issue for multiple credit balance adjustments and payments and test resolution. 

# dbt_zuora v0.1.0
ðŸŽ‰ This is the initial release of this package! ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸ“£ What does this dbt package do?
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Zuora data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/zuora) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/zuora#schemainformation) and build off the output of our [Zuora source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_zuora_source).
- The above mentioned models enable you to better understand your Zuora performance metrics at different granularities. It achieves this by:
    - Providing intuitive reporting at the account and the subscription levels.
    - Creates a billing history model at the invoice level and a line item history model to evaluate data at the invoice item level. 
    - Builds a daily overview of account balance activity using the billing history data. 
    - Generates a monthly recurring revenue table at the account level. 
    - A churn analysis model is also available in the analysis folder to evaluate account churn at the monthly level. More details area available in the [DECISIONLOG](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_zuora/blob/main/DECISIONLOG.md).
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled Zuora data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_zuora/).
